# Visualize data in R with ggplot2 <br/>
## ggplot2 <br/>

The ggplot2 package lets us make high quality, customizable plots of the data. <br/>
The ggplot2 is based on [the grammar of graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448), so we can build any plot from the same basic components, like building blocks. <br/>

Building blocks include:

 - **A dataset**
 - **A set of geoms:** A geom refers to the geometric object used to represent our data. For example, we can use points to create a scatterplot, bars to create a bar chart, lines to create a line diagram, etc. 
 - **A set of aesthetic attributes:** An aesthetic is a visual property of an object in our plot. We can think of an aesthetic as a connection, or mapping, between a visual feature in our plot and a variable in our data. For example, in a scatterplot, aesthetics include things like the size, shape, color, or location (x-axis, y-axis) of our data points. 


## Preparing the data
W'll use R code to specify the dataset, geom, and aesthetics of the plot.
